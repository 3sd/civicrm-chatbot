# Getting started

Once you have installed the chatbot extension ([installation instruction here](installation.md)) there are a couple of things you will need to do.

1. [Configure chat services](service/configure.md) for the chat services that you want to use
2. Define some [conversation types](conversation-types.md) for the different conversations you want to have with your contacts.

Once you've done that, you will be able to [start conversations](starting-conversations.md) with contacts and [monitor chat messages and conversations](chat-activities-and-tab.md) in CiviCRM.
