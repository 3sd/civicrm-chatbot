# Installation

Installation for Chatbot is the same as for any other extension.

## Download

Until Chatbot becomes approved for automated download, you will need to manually download it and extract it to your extensions directory.

You can find the latest stable release here: [https://github.com/3sd/civicrm-chatbot/releases](https://github.com/3sd/civicrm-chatbot/releases).

## Install

Once you have downloaded and extracted the extension to your extensions directory, it should appear on the manage extensions page. Enable it and you should be ready to [get started](getting-started.md).
