# Configuring a chat services

Chatbot is built to integrate with multiple chat services. Currently it integrates with CiviCRM's built in SMS service, [CiviSMS](civisms.md) and also with [Facebook messenger](facebook.md).

To use Chatbot with your preferred service, please follow the instructions below:

- [Configure CiviSMS](civisms.md)
- [Configure Facebook messenger](facebook.md)

Once configured, you can use the chat service to chat with any contacts that have an account with that service.

## Other services

If you would like to use a different chat service, read [integrating with other chat services](other.md).
