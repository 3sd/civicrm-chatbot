## Integrating with other chat services

It should be reasonably straight forward to add support to any of the following chat services:

- Amazon Alexa
- Cisco Spark
- Facebook Messenger
- Hangouts Chat
- HipChat
- Microsoft Bot Framework
- Nexmo
- Slack
- Telegram
- Twilio
- Web
- WeChat

This is because each of these services are supported by Botman.io - the framework upon which Chatbot is built.*

Other chat services could also be supported (by creating a Botman driver for the service) but this would require a bit more work.

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/3sd/civicrm-chatbot/issues) if you would like us to add an integration for a new chat service. Alternatively, if you would like the add the service yourself, we welcome your contribution. Please see the [*Contributing* section of the README](https://github.com/3sd/civicrm-chatbot#contributing) before you start.

\* please see the [Botman documentation](https://botman.io/2.0/) for an up to date list of services that Botman supports.
